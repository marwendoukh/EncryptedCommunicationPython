# Encrypted communication with Python

This is a basic encrypted communication example with Python made by Marwen Doukh

#How to use it ?

1. Run server.py in your server 
2. Run client.py in your machine
3. The server will send you the current logged user (just an example, you can change it)

**You can run it in the same PC as well , just open two Terminals**

**Make sure that you put the "myowncertif" folder in the same directory as server.py : it contains the TLS certificates**

Communicate securely and protect your privacy , Enjoy !
